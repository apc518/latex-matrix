# latex_matrix
Simple webpage for generating latex code for matrices

### Usage
Go to the [project webpage](https://jasonwarta.com/latex.html) or download the standalone html file and open it in your web browser.

To use the generated latex in a latex document, you must import the __amsmath__ package, by putting `\usepackage{amsmath}` near the top of your document.
