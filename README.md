# latex_matrix
Simple webpage for generating latex code for matrices

### Usage
Go to the [project webpage](https://latex-matrix.netlify.app/) or download this repo and open index.html in a browser.

To use the generated latex in a latex document, you must import the __amsmath__ package, by putting `\usepackage{amsmath}` near the top of your document.
